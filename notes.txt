Presentation Strategy:
- already have a build.gradle that works
- already have a utils method for reading files from the class path
- already have a utils method for a string as a list of characters
- bonus: treat lists as lazy streams
- bonus: process collection of accounts in parallel using gpars

* Create an App
lazybones create groovy-app ojug-bankocr

** Modify Gradle
*** add JCenter repository
	jcenter()

*** dependencies to pull in lastest spock, spock reporting
dependencies {
	compile     "org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.4.1"
	testCompile "org.spockframework:spock-core:1.0-groovy-2.4"
	testCompile 'com.athaydes:spock-reports:1.2.3'
}

** Think about the problem. Conceptually, it be great to convert list-of-lines into a list-of-ocr-digit-strings, then convert each ocr-digit into a decimal-digit, collect decimal-digit into an account-number.

** Step 1 -> convert list-of-lines into list of ocr-digits. Each line contains 1/3 of each digit. It'd be nice to break apart each line and put the top, middle and bottom 1/3's of each OCR digit together.

** Step 2 -> pull in the OCR Digits Enum class. It would take a while to type this class up and it's really pretty simple. It contains the mapping between OCR Digit String and Decimal Number.

* Step 3 -> 

gradle test --rerun-tasks

*  Table driven tests in Spock
